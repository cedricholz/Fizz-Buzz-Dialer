# Fizz-Buzz-Dialer


A Twilio Flask application that will call an input phone number, and ask for a number between 1 and 1000. It will then count up to the input number from one, but will say "Fizz" instead of numbers divisible by 3, "Buzz," instead of numbers divisible by 5, and "Fizzbuzz," for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.

It also keeps a log of the calls made and when the replay button is pressed, the number in its history will be called, and the Fizzbuzz for the number previously entered will be repeated.
